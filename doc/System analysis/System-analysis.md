# System Analysis | System Design

System analysis is to examine a `business problem`, identify its objectives and `requirements`, and then design the most `optimal` solution to fulfill those needs.

## System Analysis

It is the very first step in any system development and the critical phase where developers come together to understand the problem, needs, and objectives of the project.

Some of the key aspects of system analysis are:

- Problem Identification
- Requirements Gathering
- Feasibility Study
- Analysis and Modeling
- Scope Definition

# System Design

System design is where the projectâ€™s `blueprint` is created. It involves transforming the requirements identified in the `analysis phase` into a visual solution.

- Architecture design
- Database configuration
- Communication system
- Algorithm Design
- Security
- Test and Maintenance
- Documentation

# Types of Systems

- `Open Systems`: An open system is the one that interacts freely with the external factors. These systems are capable of adapting the changes made within the system.

**Example:** business organizations

- `Closed Systems`: A closed system is one which is contained within itself. It does not have any interaction with the environment.

**Example:** A computer system

- `Adaptive Systems`: Adaptive systems are those that change their behavior with the changing environment.

**Example:** constantly changing market.

- `Dynamic Systems`: Dynamic systems are those that change and evolve over a period of time.

**Example:** ecological system change with factors like climate change.
