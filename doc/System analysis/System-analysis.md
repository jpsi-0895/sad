# System Analysis | System Design

System analysis is to examine a `business problem`, identify its objectives and `requirements`, and then design the most `optimal` solution to fulfill those needs.

## System Analysis

It is the very first step in any system development and the critical phase where developers come together to understand the problem, needs, and objectives of the project.

Some of the key aspects of system analysis are:

- Problem Identification
- Requirements Gathering
- Feasibility Study
- Analysis and Modeling
- Scope Definition

# System Design

System design is where the projectâ€™s `blueprint` is created. It involves transforming the requirements identified in the `analysis phase` into a visual solution.
