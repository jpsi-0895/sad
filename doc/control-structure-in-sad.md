In the context of Structured Analysis and Design (`SAD`), control structures are a fundamental concept used to represent the flow of logic and control in a system. 

SAD is a methodology used for analyzing and designing information systems, and control structures play a crucial role in defining how processes are managed and executed.

## Control Structures in Structured Analysis and Design

In SAD, control structures are typically visualized and specified using diagrams and models. 

These control structures help in designing the sequence of operations, `decision-making`, and looping mechanisms within the system. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of common control structures and how they are used in SAD:
