# DFD (Data Flow Diagram)

Data Flow Diagram (`DFD`) represents the flow of data within information systems.

Data Flow Diagram (DFD) `does not have a control flow` and `no loops` or `decision rules` are present.

**Properties:**

- It should be pointed out that a DFD is not a flowchart.

- The Data Flow Diagram (DFD) belongs to structured-analysis modeling tools.

Specific operations, depending on the type of data, can be explained by a flowchart. It is a graphical tool, useful for communicating with users, managers and other personnel. It is useful for analyzing existing as well as proposed systems.

It provides an overview of

- What data is system processes.
- What transformation are performed.
- What data are stored.
- What results are produced , etc.


**SA/SD involves 2 phases:**

- `Analysis Phase`: It uses Data Flow Diagram, `Data Dictionary`, State Transition diagram and ER diagram. 
- `Design Phase`: It uses Structure Chart and Pseudo Code.
